          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            Founded in 2010 by renowned chef Marie Dubois and sommelier Jean-Pierre Laurent, 
            Caf√© Fausse began as a dream to create an intimate dining experience that celebrates

            traditional boundaries while maintaining the authenticity of exceptional flavors. 
            We believe in creating "false" expectations only to exceed them with genuine excellence.
