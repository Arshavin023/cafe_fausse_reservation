# üõí Caf√© Fausse Reservation System

This is a web application for Caf√© Fausse, a fictional coffee shop. The system allows customers to view the menu, learn about the cafe, and make table reservations. It is built using the Flask web framework and a PostgreSQL database.

# How Reservation Works

To combat the issue of no-shows and ensure the efficient use of our seating, the reservation system employs a credit card hold mechanism.
When a customer makes a reservation, the system requires their credit card details. These details are used to place a temporary authorization hold for a small amount (e.g., $10 per person). This is not a charge, but a verification that the card is valid and has sufficient funds.
Successful Authorization: The reservation is confirmed and the table is secured.
Failed Authorization: The reservation is not created, and the user is prompted to try again with a valid card.
In the event of a no-show, the caf√© reserves the right to convert the authorization hold into a final charge, compensating the business for the lost opportunity. This ensures a fairer system for all customers and staff.
